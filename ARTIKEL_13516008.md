# Abstract

Data is a pretty powerful and important thing in life, it could be used to do a lot of things from things like predicting the price of a product, calculating the probability of disaster on one region or nation, calculating the result of an undergoing election and many more. Due to that there's some method involved in using and gathering data, first is what we know as Data Scraping in which we gather Data from a specific Domain, mainly a website and filter the element needed to get the result we want. After we get the Data the next thing we do is known as Data Visualization, in which we make the Data that we already gather which usually result in a format that eye can't properly read to a readable data. To make this data readable we use things like Chart which consist of a lot of things like for example bar chart, which are chart that are usually used to Discrite Data and visualize it as a bar that shows how much of the plot there, Line Chart, which are used by continous data and represent data as a line in which we can plot some of the data we gather and it will make a path from those Data. 

# Data Introduction

From the Data I've Scraped from IMDB before, which result in a json file that contains, title, rating, description, poster, genres, casts, and production years of the movie, Now I move to the second step of Data Mining, which is Data Visualization, to make the Data I've already scraped which result in a JSON file now readable by human eye. In this Article I will show one of the Data I've already Visualized which is the Line Chart of the Data which shows how much a movie genre is created on a certain year. The Graph I was talking about is down below this text.

# Data Explanation

Movie genres such as Film-Noir just appear for a few year than dissapears completely while genres like Action Movies popularity increase until it reached 29 movie out of 100 sample in a year on 2013.
